                <p>I’d like to extend a congratulations to my team consisting of Steven Miller, Andrew Stengel, Daniel Slutsky and Brian Yeh, and our team mentor, Paul Church. We volunteered for a portfolio based challenge where teams identify creative new features and functionality of the Global IT Service Catalog, competing to get 1st place and awarded the opportunity to UPS’ CIO. Thankfully, this challenge, as well as my team, helped me learn the value of the Customer Experience Improvement, Solution Innovation and Research and Analysis Skill. By addressing these three areas, we received the opportunity to present to our portfolio manager, Jim Medeiros as well as several notable UPSers which report to him directly.</p>
                <p><span class="image fit"><img src="img/pic3.jpg" alt=""></span>Consequently, we presented to Juan Perez and portfolio managers which report to him and received a lot of helpful feedback with our ideas as well as an understanding of the value we added to UPS. I appreciate all the opportunities UPS has presented to me this summer, and I would like to thank Bob Almberg, Bruce Swanson and Bob Sagerer for all of their efforts for making my internship experience as great as it was.</p>
